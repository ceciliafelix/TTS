## What you should do

1. Open up the Command Line and change directory until you’re inside the TTS folder, where your
designs are stored (oops you don’t have one? Well make it, while your at it make a file called taco,jpg),
but make sure that you are on the desktop first.
2. Wait, are you in the right folder, right? How do you check and make sure this is where you stored your
design
3. Next, initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the folder. The folder should now be a
Git repository.
4. If everything looks good to go add the files to your local Git repository so they’ll be tracked by Git.
5. Now, take a “snapshot” of the repository as it stands now using the commit command.
6. But your co-workers, hard at work in their own local repositories, can’t see your fantastic new design.
That’s because the main project is stored in the company GitHub account (create a repo on your
gitHub account called TTS. Since you haven’t connected to the GitHub repo yet, your computer doesn’t
even know this exists. So tell your local repository about it.
7. Better And double check to make sure it knows.
8. Upload your file to the project
